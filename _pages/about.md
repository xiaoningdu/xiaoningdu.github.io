I am a Senior Lecturer (equivalent to U.S. Associate Professor) at the [Department of Software Systems and Cybersecurity](https://www.monash.edu/it/ssc) of the [Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/it).
I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Nanyang Technological University under the supervision of [Prof. Yang Liu](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/), and received my Bachelor's degree from Fudan University.


My research primarily focuses on the security and quality assurance of intelligent software systems, with a particular emphasis on intelligent software engineering tools. 
I am best known for my contributions to [Devign](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2019/file/49265d2447bc3bbfe9e76306ce40a31f-Paper.pdf), [BigCodeBench](https://bigcode-bench.github.io/), [DeepStellar](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3338906.3338954) and [SimPy](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3650212.3680347). 
I am the recepient of [2024 Google Research Scholar Award](https://research.google/programs-and-events/research-scholar-program/recipients/) in Software Engineering, and my work has been recognized with ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award and ICLR Oral.


I am looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students with strong programming skills and relevant research experience. The position is sponsored by [full scholarships](https://www.monash.edu/it/research/graduate-research/scholarships-and-support/scholarships-and-applications). Please send me an email with your CV if you are interested. For Monash undergraduate and master students who wish to do honours or minor thesis with me, please check the [available projects](https://supervisorconnect.it.monash.edu/supervisors/xiaoning-du) and send me a copy of your transcript when expressing interest.
