I am a lecturer (a.k.a. Assistant Professor) at the [Department of Software Systems and Cybersecurity](https://www.monash.edu/it/ssc) of the [Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/it).
I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Nanyang Technological University under the supervision of [Prof. Yang Liu](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/), and received my Bachelor's degree from Fudan University.

I am the recepient of [2024 Google Research Scholar Award](https://research.google/programs-and-events/research-scholar-program/recipients/) in Software Engineering, and my work has been recognized with ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award and ICLR Oral.


I am looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students with strong programming skills and relevant research experience.
